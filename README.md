# survival_prediction
Developing a machine learning project focused on predicting survival outcomes. Leveraging the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger details like age, gender, class, and fare, to analyze patterns and improve accuracy in survival predictions.
This project aims to enhance decision-making and resource allocation in critical areas like healthcare, disaster management, and more.
Additionally, deploying the model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for real-time predictions and user-friendly visualization.
